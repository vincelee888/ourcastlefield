    "The Gardening and Environment Action Group")


    # Purpose


    To work in conjunction with Friends of the Roman Gardens, MCC and other
    local partners to keep the area attractive, green and tidy. The group also
    works in liaison with MCC and local partners to present a credible entry to
    the ‘It’s Your Neighbourhood’ section of North West in Bloom, aiming for a
    Level 5 ‘Outstanding’ award.


    # Background


    Castlefield entered ‘It’s Your Neighbourhood’ in 2010 for the first time and
    was awarded an amazing Level 5, ‘Outstanding’ for our efforts. We gained a
    similar Level 5 in 2011 and 2012. In 2013 we were awarded Level 4. We did
    not consider that we were in a position to present a credible entry in 2014
    but were awarded Level 5 in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
