    "The Gardening and Environment Action Group")


    # Action Group


    This group works in conjunction with Friends of the Roman Gardens, MCC and
    other local partners to keep the area attractive, green and tidy. The group
    also works in liaison with MCC and local partners to present a credible
    entry to the ‘It’s Your Neighbourhood’ section of North West in Bloom,
    aiming for a Level 5 ‘Outstanding’ award.


    **If you'd like to join this or any of our actions groups, please email us
    at info@ourcastlefield.co.uk**


    ## Background


    Castlefield entered ‘It’s Your Neighbourhood’ in 2010 for the first time and
    was awarded an amazing Level 5, ‘Outstanding’ for our efforts. We gained a
    similar Level 5 in 2011 and 2012. In 2013 we were awarded Level 4. We did
    not consider that we were in a position to present a credible entry in 2014
    but were awarded Level 5 in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
