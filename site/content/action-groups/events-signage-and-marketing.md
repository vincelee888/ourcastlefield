    Group")


    # Action Group


    This group has the purpose of raising the profile of Castlefield within the
    city. It works to develop our own events and contribute to events organised
    by others, and to develop greater financial self-reliance for the Forum by
    developing Castlefield’s marketing potential, to include development of
    www.ourcastlefield.co.uk   


    ## **Background**


    **Events**


    A wide range of events have taken place in the Castlefield Arena and
    surrounding area over the past few years. These are mostly externally
    developed events, through MCC Events Team although as a Forum we have worked
    in partnership with T3 Events since 2015 in the planning & promotion of the
    annual Castlefield Food Festival. We aim to continue our close liaison with
    the Council Events Team and others who wish to stage large & small-scale
    events in the area and also plan and deliver smaller events aimed at the
    local community.


    This group also oversees the website and the Forum’s Twitter, Facebook and
    Instagram accounts. All of which would benefit from further development.
    Signage around the Castlefield area (see below) has also been added to the
    remit of this group.


    **Website**


    The Forum website has primarily been used as a repository for meeting
    minutes and communicating news about the area.  However, we feel it’s
    currently an underused resource.  Are you budding web-designer with some
    time to spare? If so please contact us. Even if you only have enough time to
    train a few novices, your input would be extremely valuable.


    **Signage**


    The group works to develop and deliver a programme of works to refurbish and
    replace existing signage and identify locations of historical importance and
    gateway areas for new signage. The aim is to enhance the enjoyment and
    understanding of the Castlefield area and its history for residents and
    visitors.


    The Forum has successfully applied for Neighbourhood Investment funding from
    Manchester City Council to improve and replace damaged and out-of-date
    signage in the area. All the existing signage has been replaced and planning
    permission has been obtained for of a programme new signs to improve the
    interpretation of the area. Compiling the content for new signage is ongoing
    and help with this fascinating research into Castlefield’s history is most
    welcome.
