  body: "![](/assets/uploads/market-banner.jpg \"Events, Signage and Marketing Action Group\")\n\nThis group has the purpose of raising the profile of Castlefield within the city. It works to develop our own events and contribute to events organised by others, and to develop greater financial self-reliance for the Forum by developing Castlefield’s marketing potential, to include development of www.ourcastlefield.co.uk   \r\n\n**Background**\r\n\nA wide range of events have taken place in the Castlefield Arena and surrounding area over the past few years. These are mostly externally developed events, through MCC Events Team although as a Forum we have worked in partnership with T3 Events since 2015 in the planning & promotion of the annual Castlefield Food Festival. We aim to continue our close liaison with the Council Events Team and others who wish to stage large & small-scale events in the area and also plan and deliver smaller events aimed at the local community.\r\n\nThis group also oversees the website (see additional section below) and the Forum’s Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts. All of which would benefit from further development. Signage around the Castlefield area (see below) has also been added to the remit of this group.\r\n\n**Activities**\r\n\n* ensure events in Castlefield and the Arena are varied and appropriate   \r\n* act as a sounding board for the Council Events Unit in reaching decisions about event requests\r\n* review established events looking at opportunities for Forum participation\r\n* develop Forum events in Castlefield through consultation with residents and businesses  \r\n* build contacts with event organisers\r\n* build relationships with businesses with a view to sponsorship of merchandise, events, publications and projects \r\n* oversee & develop Social Media strategy\r\n* develop and administer our website www.ourcastlefield.co.uk\r\n\n\r\n\n**Website (additional information)**\r\n\n**Background**  \r\n\nThe Forum website has primarily been used as a repository for meeting minutes and communicating news about the area.  However, we feel it’s currently an underused resource.  Are you budding web-designer with some time to spare? If so please contact us. Even if you only have enough time to train a few novices, your input would be extremely valuable.\r\n\n**Activities**\r\n\n* help design a modern, user friendly website\r\n* link the website more effectively with other social media\r\n* administer the website\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n**Signage (Additional information)**\r\n\n**Purpose**\r\n\nThe group works to develop and deliver a programme of works to refurbish and replace existing signage and identify locations of historical importance and gateway areas for new signage. The aim is to enhance the enjoyment and understanding of the Castlefield area and its history for residents and visitors.\r\n\n**Background**\r\n\nThe Forum has successfully applied for Neighbourhood Investment funding from Manchester City Council to improve and replace damaged and out-of-date signage in the area. All the existing signage has been replaced and planning permission has been obtained for of a programme new signs to improve the interpretation of the area.
