    # Action Group


    This group is working to design and deliver an exciting, inspiring urban
    retreat for Manchester city centre. 


    **If you would like to get involved with this or any of our action groups,
    please email us on info@ourcastlefield.co.uk**


    ## Background


    Our site, the Castlefield gardens between the White Lion and Oxnoble, is
    relatively compact which means that delivering something interesting and
    inspiring is especially important. This is a once-in-a-generation
    opportunity. Think big, aim high. Come and join the Liverpool Road Gateway
    project and be part of an amazing journey.
