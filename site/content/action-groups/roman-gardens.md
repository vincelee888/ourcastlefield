    # Action Group


    This group is working to design and deliver an exciting, inspiring urban
    retreat for Manchester city centre.

    ## Background

    relatively compact which means that delivering something interesting and
    inspiring is especially important. This is a once-in-a-generation
    opportunity. Think big, aim high. Come and join the Liverpool Road Gateway
    project and be part of an amazing journey.
