    Castlefield, the oldest part of the city, boasts Manchesterâ€™s Roman origins,
    the first passenger railway in the world and the oldest of the Industrial
    Revolution canals.

    Our Castlefield is the website of the Castlefield Forum.


    The Forum was set up to contribute to and influence Castlefield as a
    locality, whilst conserving and enhancing its heritage assets, for the
    benefit of all members of the community and visitors to the area.


    Our objectives are:


    * To protect and promote the Castlefield Conservation Area

    * To secure the preservation, protection, development and improvement of
    features or areas of historic or public interest.

    * To promote the conservation of the environment

    * To educate the public in the geography, history, natural history, culture
    and architecture of the area

    * To promote high standards of planning and architecture

    * To promote urban regeneration


    The Forum consists of a volunteer committee and several action groups who
    work to meet these objectives. It's a great way to meet others in the
    community, to have a say in what happens and to give something back  to this
    amazing place.


    **If you'd like to join any of our action groups, please email us at
